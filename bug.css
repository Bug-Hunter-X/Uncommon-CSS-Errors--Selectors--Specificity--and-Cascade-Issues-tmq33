The CSS code is causing unexpected behavior because it uses an invalid or unsupported selector.  For example, using an attribute selector with an incorrect syntax or trying to target elements using a selector that is not supported by all browsers can lead to unexpected results.  Another common issue is when the CSS specificity is not well managed leading to unexpected styles overriding others.  Incorrect use of the `!important` flag can also cause cascading order to fail.
